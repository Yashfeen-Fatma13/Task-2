# Task-2
Data Visualization and story telling\


Explanation :

As a data analyst, my objective was to create visualizations in Tableau that not only display data but also tell a compelling and insightful story. I began by understanding the dataset thoroughlyâ€”identifying trends, patterns, and key variables that could provide meaningful insights.

Using Tableau, I developed a series of interactive dashboards that simplify complex data into clear visual narratives. Each chart, graph, and filter was carefully chosen to highlight important aspects of the data, such as performance trends over time, comparisons between categories, and correlations between variables.

The visualizations are designed to guide the viewer step-by-step through the data story, helping them draw conclusions and make data-driven decisions easily. By focusing on clarity, usability, and storytelling, I ensured that the dashboards are not just visually appealing but also actionable for stakeholders.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how data visualization can bridge the gap between raw data and strategic insights, turning numbers into stories that drive better decisions.
